      <h3 class="question">What is our website about?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Our Diabetes Prediction Website helps users check their risk of diabetes by entering basic health-related details like age, symptoms, and gender. The result is predicted using a trained machine learning model. Based on the outcome, users can also view helpful health tips and find nearby hospitals for further care.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">What is BMI and why is it important?</h3>
      <p class="answer">BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple measure that helps assess whether your weight is healthy in relation to your height. It plays a significant role in evaluating your risk for diabetes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">How accurate is this Diabetes Prediction tool?</h3>
      <p class="answer">This tool uses data-driven models for estimation. While it's built on reliable data, it cannot replace a diagnosis from a medical professional.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">What health data is used for prediction?</h3>
      <p class="answer">The prediction in this website is based on health-related data such as age, gender, and symptoms like excessive urination, thirst, sudden weight loss, weakness, blurred vision, itching, irritability, and other early signs that help identify the risk of developing diabetes using a machine learning model.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">Is my personal data stored or shared?</h3>
      <p class="answer">No. This tool is designed for privacy — your data is only used temporarily for calculation and is not saved or shared.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">Can this tool be used to detect both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?</h3>
      <p class="answer">This tool is designed to predict the general risk of developing diabetes, without specifically distinguishing between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It is more aligned with detecting Type 2 diabetes risk, since the dataset and symptoms used (like frequent urination, thirst, weight loss, etc.) are commonly associated with early-stage Type 2 diabetes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">Is the BMI calculator suitable for all age groups?</h3>
      <p class="answer">While BMI gives a general indication, its interpretation can vary for children, older adults, and athletes. Use with care.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">What is the purpose of the Diabetes Prediction project?</h3>
      <p class="answer">The purpose is to provide an early warning system using accessible inputs, helping users take preventive measures toward a healthier life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">Can I rely solely on this website for health decisions?</h3>
      <p class="answer">No. This is a supportive tool, not a diagnostic system. Always consult a doctor for health-related decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">How often should I check my diabetes risk?</h3>
      <p class="answer">It’s recommended to check annually or whenever there are significant lifestyle changes or health concerns.</p>
